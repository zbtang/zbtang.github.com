<p>At <a href="http://www.avalonbiometrics.com">Avalon Biometrics</a> we are hiring again
and I'm now driving some technical interviews. I thought that everybody did this more or
less the same way but looks like there is a great discussion about this.</p>

<p>So we often follow the same process. For senior positions we previouly ask for a really
simple coding exercise using the technologies we require. Then, for the people that
sends a response we often schedule a meeting in person or through skype and we follow the
following process:
  <ul>
    <li>We introduce ourselves personally and as a company and talk a little bit about what
we do and what we expect from a candidate. We also describe our products and such. This 
ussually takes no more than 5 or 10 min. We do this for respect and education. It also helps
the candidate calm a little bit because people is ussually nervous when they come here.</li>
    <li>Then the candidate goes through his CV telling us a bit about what he did in the
past. We often don't make this go more than 10 min.</li>
    <li>Lastly we go to a pair programming session. In case of senior candidates we use the
test they sent us as a starting point so the candidate is confortable already with the code.
In case of a junior we go through a simple kata. We often spend one hour or so here. It 
depends a lot on the candidate. Our decision is fundamentally based on what happens here.
I try to turn this more into a conversation around coding. I try to ask a lot of questions
and propose different ways of doing the same thing. I try to turn this into a collaboration
session. What we want to check here is if a candidate is capable of communicating with a
teammate what his ideas are and if he is able to support them. In case of senior people since
we already have a small base we can discuss patterns or best practices and with juniors since
its just a kata we talk about style, naming and such.</li>
    <li>After this I just thank the candidate for his time and after some time we contact him
with a economic offer if we think he fits here.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Maybe it's not the best way to drive an interview but I thinkn its respectful enough with
both parts. My experience with this is that there is some people that somehow manage to turn
the pairing session in a really fun and interesting thing where we talk a lot about a simple
piece of software. It's like some chemistry. I really think its easier to tell if somebody will
fit in a group if you code with him just for a brief period of time than reading another boring
CV.</p>
