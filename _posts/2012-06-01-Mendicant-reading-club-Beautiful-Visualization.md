I'll be driving a [book club session at mendicant university](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/21/reading-club-beautiful-visualization). 
We'll be reading (if there is somebody interested in joining in)
[Beautiful Visualization](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000617.do). I've
recently became interested in UX and visualization of large amounts of data is,
at this moment, for me an art more than a science. I hope we are able to throw
some light over this topic. 

I'll try to keep the discussion running by asking questions and organizing small
debates. 

This is the first time I do something like this but I hope this is a good
experience for everybody.
