      <h2>How to ask for features</h2>
    </header>
    <section class="post_text"><h3 id='requirements'>Requirements</h3>

<p>Communication between stakeholders has always been a sticky issue in any software development project. It&#8217;s an art. If you can handle that, you have taken a big step forward into building a successful product.</p>

<p>I found that the problem arises early. When the whole team is &#8220;gathering requirements&#8221;. That&#8217;s the first fallacy. There are no such thing as requirements. Well&#8230; almost. The word &#8220;requirement&#8221; means:</p>

<pre><code>_That which is required; an imperative or authoritative
        command; an essential condition; something needed or
        necessary; a need.
        [1913 Webster]_</code></pre>

<p>A requirement is something essential. Something non negotiable and I don&#8217;t like that idea. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of such &#8220;requirements&#8221; pour like rair when there is no time or the money is running out. I found much better talking about features. Features are something that adds value to your software. You can add or remove features depending on your resources and needs. That is, for sure, a better situation to deal with.</p>

<p>Also when you gather your features it is common to write use cases. Usually I found that to be too much. Often the feature set you&#8217;ll add to your application will change a lot during the development. If you have a custome he will change his mind and if you don&#8217;t you&#8217;ll find that your users demand a different thing. Doing a big analysis first has really proven to be unuseful.</p>

<h3 id='user_stories'>User stories</h3>

<p>For me it has proven of greater value to write simple <strong>user stories</strong>. What is a <strong>user story</strong>?</p>

<pre><code>\[...\]a user story is one or more sentences in the everyday or business language 
of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as 
part of his or her job function. \[...\] It captures the &#39;who&#39;, &#39;what&#39; and &#39;why&#39; 
of a requirement in a simple, concise way, often limited in detail by what can be 
hand-written on a small paper notecard.</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so what do we have here?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A user story must use the language of the end user</strong>. As developers we ussually drive the user into talking about severs, java, data types and such. That is fundamentally wrong. We must know what problem we are solving. That&#8217;s why we are limited to the user language. To avoid losing focus. We have not yet though about <em>how</em> to solve the problem. We are focusing in <em>what</em> to solve.</li>

<li><strong>A user story must capture why we want to solve the problem</strong>. Often we fix problems that are not there just to &#8220;anticipate&#8221; and later we find out that we failed miserably in our diagnosis. Also we will need to evaluate how important is a user story and knowing why are we implementing it is a huge help. Also adding the <em>why</em> forces us to write user stories that provide <strong>bussines value</strong> instead of just writing software without direction.</li>

<li><strong>A user story must be short</strong>. Writing user stories must not be a lot of work. Also their scope must be limited. If we can&#8217;t describe a problem in one or two sentences probably we don&#8217;t fully understand it yet or we need to decompose it into some smaller pieces.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to gather all the features we want in our software we don&#8217;t want a 1000 pages document nobody is going to read. We will do just fine with a bunch of small cards with some text written on it.</p>

<p>Looks simple? It isn&#8217;t. In fact writing good user stories is somehow an art, but it has proven to be one awesome skill to have.</p>

<p>I often use a pattern to write user stories so I never forget anything. The pattern goes like:</p>

<pre><code>As a ...
I want to ...
In order to ...</code></pre>

<p>That way I don&#8217;t forget to add &#8216;who&#8217;, &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;why&#8217;.</p>

<p>I also like to add a litte thing to the user story. In the same card, although not mandatory I like to add how i&#8217;m going to check that the user story is completed, again using bussiness language. That forces me to talk in specific terms instead of overgeneralizing making my stories more useable and manageable.</p>

<h3 id='some_examples'>Some examples</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s see some examples:</p>

<pre><code>As a border control officer
I want to be able to check if the passenger&#39;s passport number is in the control list
In order to avoid criminals entering or exiting the country

To test it we will start a transit with a blacklisted passport. The system must alert the
officer. Then we will do the same transit with a non blacklisted passport.</code></pre>

<p>If at that moment we don&#8217;t have blacklist probably it&#8217;s the moment to implement it. Mybe we already have a blacklist but it does not support yet passport numbers.</p>

<p>This makes us grow around software around features that give our software <strong>bussiness value</strong>. We will make our changes as small as possible while fulfilling the stories to give the most value in the least time.</p>

<p>If I had written the story before as follows:</p>

<pre><code>As a border control officer
I want to be able to check if the passenger is in the control list
In order to avoid criminals entering or exiting the country

To test it we will start a transit with a blacklisted passport. The system must alert the
officer. Then we will do the same transit with a non blacklisted passport. Then we will
try will a passenger whose name and nationality are blacklisted. Afterwards we will try
a passenger with a blacklisted visa....</code></pre>

<p>We see that this story is getting really difficult to test. This often indicates that we should break the story into smaller stories. The real value in this is that we deal with smaller problems and we can postpone some of the parts later on the development to have always the most important feature set.</p>

<p>Also another patter for poorly written story is the following:</p>

<pre><code>As a shop owner
I want the report on daily sales to look nicer
In order to be able to search easily the amount sold every day

To test it we will open the daily sales report and see if its nice.</code></pre>

<p>Ok. I promise I&#8217;ve seen user stories like the one before. Imagine you are responsible for doing this. I&#8217;d think to myself &#8220;What the hell am I supposed to do?&#8221; Often we find these &#8220;diffuse&#8221; histories. Usually the problem is that we didn&#8217;t dug deep enough into the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is difficult to search easily the sales report?: Because the totals are slow to find</li>

<li>Why are they slow to find?: Because each of them is on a different place.</li>

<li>What can we do?: Align the numbers to the right of the report and add the sum of them at the end of the report.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then we build again two user stories: one for aligning the numbers to the right and another one for adding the total to the end of the page.</p>

<h3 id='wrapping_up'>Wrapping up</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve just seen a little glimpse of what user stories are. Keeping things simple is one of the benefits we can get of using this way of features gathering. Also we get a lot of atomic pieces we can reorder to get our priorities sorted out. In sum, I find easier to work with this kind of features that with those big old UML use cases documents.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p></section>
