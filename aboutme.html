    <p>My name is Rafael de Castro. I live and develop software in Madrid, Spain although
    I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n">Gij√≥n</a>. This
    is my little page where I drop some content from time to time. Mostly about software
    development but who knows. This is a personal page anyhow.</p>

    <p>I'm also the proud father of a little kid. She helps me a lot and with 1 year
    she writes better code than I do. Well maybe not... but she's really cute. </p>

    <p>You will often find me at <a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org/">Mendicant University</a> 
    participating in whichever event we may organize. The MU is a
    group of programmers that want to learn together and leave a positive impact on the
    world. If you don't know a lot about MU you should check its 
    <a href="https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Newcomer's-Guide-to-Mendicant">newcomers guide</a>
    and the <a href="https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Community-guidelines">
community guidelines</a> to understand a little bit what it is.

    <p>I've been a coder since I can remember. Starting with an Amstrad CPC 6128 that my parents bought me
    coding small Basic programs until now... Software development is my passion and I try to do it just
    a little bit better each day. You can find some chops I made at <a href="http://github.com/rafadc">Github</a>.
    There is nothing too fancy there but, you know, it's my little space.</p>
